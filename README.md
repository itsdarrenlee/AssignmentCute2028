# Care Unit for The Elderly

In this assignment, we will be implementing a Care Unit for The Elderly, known as CUTE. The main purpose of the CUTE is to proactively take action to ensure safe ageing. 
- The system achieves its purpose by monitoring the light intensity, movement and temperature of the surroundings regularly and send an alert warning signal to the system when movement in darkness and fire are detected.
